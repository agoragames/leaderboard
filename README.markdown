# leaderboard

Leaderboards backed by [Redis](http://redis.io) in Ruby.

Builds off ideas proposed in http://www.agoragames.com/blog/2011/01/01/creating-high-score-tables-leaderboards-using-redis/.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/agoragames/leaderboard.png)](http://travis-ci.org/agoragames/leaderboard)

## Installation

`gem install leaderboard`

or in your `Gemfile`

```ruby
gem 'leaderboard'
```

Make sure your redis server is running! Redis configuration is outside the scope of this README, but
check out the [Redis documentation](http://redis.io/documentation).

## Compatibility

The gem has been built and tested under 2.2.1.

NOTE: The gem should work fine in earlier versions of Ruby such as 1.8.7 or 1.9.3. There are no specific aspects of Ruby 2.x that we utilize at this time.

## Usage

### Creating a leaderboard

Be sure to require the leaderboard library:

```ruby
require 'leaderboard'
```

Create a new leaderboard or attach to an existing leaderboard named 'highscores':

```ruby
  highscore_lb = Leaderboard.new('highscores')
   => #<Leaderboard:0x0000010307b530 @leaderboard_name="highscores", @page_size=25, @redis_connection=#<Redis client v2.2.2 connected to redis://localhost:6379/0 (Redis v2.2.5)>>
```

### Defining leaderboard options

The `Leaderboard::DEFAULT_OPTIONS` are as follows:

```ruby
DEFAULT_OPTIONS = {
  :page_size => DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE,
  :reverse => false,
  :member_key => :member,
  :rank_key => :rank,
  :score_key => :score,
  :member_data_key => :member_data,
  :member_data_namespace => 'member_data',
  :global_member_data => false
}
```

The `DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE` is 25.

You would use the option, `:reverse => true`, if you wanted a leaderboard sorted from lowest-to-highest score. You may also set the `reverse` option on a leaderboard after you have created a new instance of a leaderboard. The various `..._key` options above control what data is returned in the hash of leaderboard data from calls such as `leaders` or `around_me`. Finally, the `global_member_data` option allows you to control whether optional member data is per-leaderboard (`false`) or global (`true`).

If you need to pass in options for Redis, you can do this in the initializer:

```ruby
  redis_options = {:host => 'localhost', :port => 6379, :db => 1}
   => {:host=>"localhost", :port=>6379, :db=>1}
  highscore_lb = Leaderboard.new('highscores', Leaderboard::DEFAULT_OPTIONS, redis_options)
   => #<Leaderboard:0x00000103095200 @leaderboard_name="highscores", @page_size=25, @redis_connection=#<Redis client v2.2.2 connected to redis://localhost:6379/1 (Redis v2.2.5)>>
```

You can pass in an existing connection to Redis using `:redis_connection` in the `redis_options` hash:

```ruby
  redis = Redis.new
   => #<Redis client v2.2.2 connected to redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0 (Redis v2.2.5)>
  redis_options = {:redis_connection => redis}
   => {:redis_connection=>#<Redis client v2.2.2 connected to redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0 (Redis v2.2.5)>}
  highscore_lb = Leaderboard.new('highscores', Leaderboard::DEFAULT_OPTIONS, redis_options)
   => #<Leaderboard:0x000001028791e8 @leaderboard_name="highscores", @page_size=25, @redis_connection=#<Redis client v2.2.2 connected to redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0 (Redis v2.2.5)>>
```

To use the same connection for multiple leaderboards, reset the options hash before instantiating more leaderboards:

```ruby
redis = Redis.new
 => #<Redis client v2.2.2 connected to redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0 (Redis v2.2.5)>
redis_options = {:redis_connection => redis}
 => {:redis_connection=>#<Redis client v2.2.2 connected to redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0 (Redis v2.2.5)>}
highscore_lb = Leaderboard.new('highscores', Leaderboard::DEFAULT_OPTIONS, redis_options)
redis_options = {:redis_connection => redis}
other_highscore_lb = Leaderboard.new('other_highscores', Leaderboard::DEFAULT_OPTIONS, redis_options)
```

You can set the page size to something other than the default page size (25):

```ruby
  highscore_lb.page_size = 5
   => 5
  highscore_lb
   => #<Leaderboard:0x000001028791e8 @leaderboard_name="highscores", @page_size=5, @redis_connection=#<Redis client v2.2.2 connected to redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0 (Redis v2.2.5)>>
```

### Ranking members in the leaderboard

Add members to your leaderboard using `rank_member`:

```ruby
  1.upto(10) do |index|
    highscore_lb.rank_member("member_#{index}", index)
  end
   => 1
```

You can call `rank_member` with the same member and the leaderboard will be updated automatically.

Get some information about your leaderboard:

```ruby
  highscore_lb.total_members
   => 10
  highscore_lb.total_pages
   => 1
```

The `rank_member` call will also accept an optional parameter, `member_data` that could
be used to store other information about a given member in the leaderboard. This
may be useful in situations where you are storing member IDs in the leaderboard and
you want to be able to store a member name for display. You could use JSON to
encode a Hash of member data. Example:

```ruby
require 'json'
highscore_lb.rank_member('84849292', 1, {'username' => 'member_name'}.to_json)
```

You can retrieve, update and remove the optional member data using the
`member_data_for`, `update_member_data` and `remove_member_data` calls. Example:

```ruby
JSON.parse(highscore_lb.member_data_for('84849292'))
 => {"username"=>"member_name"}

highscore_lb.update_member_data('84849292', {'last_updated' => Time.now, 'username' => 'updated_member_name'}.to_json)
 => "OK"
JSON.parse(highscore_lb.member_data_for('84849292'))
 => {"username"=>"updated_member_name", "last_updated"=>"2012-06-09 09:11:06 -0400"}

highscore_lb.remove_member_data('84849292')
```

If you delete the leaderboard, ALL of the member data is deleted as well.

#### Optional member data notes

If you use optional member data, the use of the `remove_members_in_score_range` or `remove_members_outside_rank` methods
will leave data around in the member data hash. This is because the internal Redis method, `zremrangebyscore`,
only returns the number of items removed. It does not return the members that it removed.

Get some information about a specific member(s) in the leaderboard:

```ruby
  highscore_lb.score_for('member_4')
   => 4.0
  highscore_lb.rank_for('member_4')
   => 7
  highscore_lb.rank_for('member_10')
   => 1
```

### Retrieving members from the leaderboard

Get page 1 in the leaderboard:

```ruby
  highscore_lb.leaders(1)
   => [{:member=>"member_10", :rank=>1, :score=>10.0}, {:member=>"member_9", :rank=>2, :score=>9.0}, {:member=>"member_8", :rank=>3, :score=>8.0}, {:member=>"member_7", :rank=>4, :score=>7.0}, {:member=>"member_6", :rank=>5, :score=>6.0}, {:member=>"member_5", :rank=>6, :score=>5.0}, {:member=>"member_4", :rank=>7, :score=>4.0}, {:member=>"member_3", :rank=>8, :score=>3.0}, {:member=>"member_2", :rank=>9, :score=>2.0}, {:member=>"member_1", :rank=>10, :score=>1.0}]
```

You can pass various options to the calls `leaders`, `all_leaders`, `around_me`, `members_from_score_range`, `members_from_rank_range` and `ranked_in_list`. Valid options are:

* `:with_member_data` - `true` or `false` (default) to return the optional member data.
* `:page_size` - An integer value to change the page size for that call.
* `:members_only` - `true` or `false` (default) to return only the members without their score and rank.
* `:sort_by` - Valid values for `:sort_by` are `:none` (default), `:score` and `:rank`.
* `:include_missing` - `true` (default) or `false` to return members that are not ranked.

You can also use the `members` and `members_in` methods as aliases for the `leaders` and `leaders_in` methods.

There are also a few convenience methods to be able to retrieve all leaders from a given leaderboard. They are `all_leaders` and `all_leaders_from`. You may also use the aliases `all_members` or `all_members_from`. Use any of these methods sparingly as all the information in the leaderboard will be returned.

Add more members to your leaderboard:

```ruby
  50.upto(95) do |index|
    highscore_lb.rank_member("member_#{index}", index)
  end
   => 50
  highscore_lb.total_pages
   => 3
```

Get an "Around Me" leaderboard page for a given member, which pulls members above and below the given member:

```ruby
  highscore_lb.around_me('member_53')
   => [{:member=>"member_65", :rank=>31, :score=>65.0}, {:member=>"member_64", :rank=>32, :score=>64.0}, {:member=>"member_63", :rank=>33, :score=>63.0}, {:member=>"member_62", :rank=>34, :score=>62.0}, {:member=>"member_61", :rank=>35, :score=>61.0}, {:member=>"member_60", :rank=>36, :score=>60.0}, {:member=>"member_59", :rank=>37, :score=>59.0}, {:member=>"member_58", :rank=>38, :score=>58.0}, {:member=>"member_57", :rank=>39, :score=>57.0}, {:member=>"member_56", :rank=>40, :score=>56.0}, {:member=>"member_55", :rank=>41, :score=>55.0}, {:member=>"member_54", :rank=>42, :score=>54.0}, {:member=>"member_53", :rank=>43, :score=>53.0}, {:member=>"member_52", :rank=>44, :score=>52.0}, {:member=>"member_51", :rank=>45, :score=>51.0}, {:member=>"member_50", :rank=>46, :score=>50.0}, {:member=>"member_10", :rank=>47, :score=>10.0}, {:member=>"member_9", :rank=>48, :score=>9.0}, {:member=>"member_8", :rank=>49, :score=>8.0}, {:member=>"member_7", :rank=>50, :score=>7.0}, {:member=>"member_6", :rank=>51, :score=>6.0}, {:member=>"member_5", :rank=>52, :score=>5.0}, {:member=>"member_4", :rank=>53, :score=>4.0}, {:member=>"member_3", :rank=>54, :score=>3.0}, {:member=>"member_2", :rank=>55, :score=>2.0}]
```

Get rank and score for an arbitrary list of members (e.g. friends) from the leaderboard:

```ruby
  highscore_lb.ranked_in_list(['member_1', 'member_62', 'member_67'])
   => [{:member=>"member_1", :rank=>56, :score=>1.0}, {:member=>"member_62", :rank=>34, :score=>62.0}, {:member=>"member_67", :rank=>29, :score=>67.0}]
```

Retrieve members from the leaderboard in a given score range:

```ruby
members = highscore_lb.members_from_score_range(4, 19)
 => [{:member=>"member_10", :rank=>47, :score=>10.0}, {:member=>"member_9", :rank=>48, :score=>9.0}, {:member=>"member_8", :rank=>49, :score=>8.0}, {:member=>"member_7", :rank=>50, :score=>7.0}, {:member=>"member_6", :rank=>51, :score=>6.0}, {:member=>"member_5", :rank=>52, :score=>5.0}, {:member=>"member_4", :rank=>53, :score=>4.0}]
```

Retrieve a single member from the leaderboard at a given position:

```ruby
members = highscore_lb.member_at(4)
 => {:member=>"member_92", :rank=>4, :score=>92.0}
```

Retrieve a range of members from the leaderboard within a given rank range:

```ruby
members = highscore_lb.members_from_rank_range(1, 5)
 => [{:member=>"member_95", :rank=>1, :score=>95.0}, {:member=>"member_94", :rank=>2, :score=>94.0}, {:member=>"member_93", :rank=>3, :score=>93.0}, {:member=>"member_92", :rank=>4, :score=>92.0}, {:member=>"member_91", :rank=>5, :score=>91.0}]
```

The option `:sort_by` is useful for retrieving an arbitrary list of
members from a given leaderboard where you would like the data sorted
when returned. The follow examples demonstrate its use:

```ruby
friends = highscore_lb.ranked_in_list(['member_6', 'member_1', 'member_10'], :sort_by => :rank)
 => [{:member=>"member_10", :rank=>47, :score=>10.0}, {:member=>"member_6", :rank=>51, :score=>6.0}, {:member=>"member_1", :rank=>56, :score=>1.0}]
```

```ruby
friends = highscore_lb.ranked_in_list(['member_6', 'member_1', 'member_10'], :sort_by => :score)
 => [{:member=>"member_1", :rank=>56, :score=>1.0}, {:member=>"member_6", :rank=>51, :score=>6.0}, {:member=>"member_10", :rank=>47, :score=>10.0}]
```

### Conditionally rank a member in the leaderboard

You can pass a lambda to the `rank_member_if` method to conditionally rank a member in the leaderboard. The lambda is passed the following 5 parameters:

* `member`: Member name.
* `current_score`: Current score for the member in the leaderboard. May be `nil` if the member is not currently ranked in the leaderboard.
* `score`: Member score.
* `member_data`: Optional member data.
* `leaderboard_options`: Leaderboard options, e.g. :reverse => Value of reverse option

```ruby
highscore_check = lambda do |member, current_score, score, member_data, leaderboard_options|
  return true if current_score.nil?
  return true if score > current_score
  false
end

highscore_lb.rank_member_if(highscore_check, 'david', 1337)
highscore_lb.score_for('david')
 => 1337.0
highscore_lb.rank_member_if(highscore_check, 'david', 1336)
highscore_lb.score_for('david')
 => 1337.0
highscore_lb.rank_member_if(highscore_check, 'david', 1338)
highscore_lb.score_for('david')
 => 1338.0
```

NOTE: Use a lambda and not a proc, otherwise you will get a `LocalJumpError` as a return statement in the proc will return from the method enclosing the proc.

### Ranking multiple members in a leaderboard at once

Insert multiple data items for members and their associated scores:

As a splat:

```ruby
highscore_lb.rank_members('member_1', 1, 'member_5', 5, 'member_10', 10)
```

Or as an array:

```ruby
highscore_lb.rank_members(['member_1', 1, 'member_5', 5, 'member_10', 10])
```

Use this method to do bulk insert of data, but be mindful of the amount of data you are inserting since a single transaction can get quite large.

### Ranking a member across multiple leaderboards

```ruby
highscore_lb.rank_member_across(['highscores', 'more_highscores'], 'david', 50000, { :member_name => "david" })
```

### Alternate leaderboard types

The leaderboard library offers 3 styles of ranking. This is only an issue for members with the same score in a leaderboard.

Default: The `Leaderboard` class uses the default Redis sorted set ordering, whereby different members having the same score are ordered lexicographically. As per the Redis documentation on Redis sorted sets, "The lexicographic ordering used is binary, it compares strings as array of bytes."

Tie ranking: The `TieRankingLeaderboard` subclass of `Leaderboard` allows you to define a leaderboard where members with the same score are given the same rank. For example, members in a leaderboard with the associated scores would have the ranks of:

```
| member     | score | rank |
-----------------------------
| member_1   | 50    | 1    |
| member_2   | 50    | 1    |
| member_3   | 30    | 2    |
| member_4   | 30    | 2    |
| member_5   | 10    | 3    |
```

The `TieRankingLeaderboard` accepts one additional option, `:ties_namespace` (default: ties), when initializing a new instance of this class. Please note that in its current implementation, the `TieRankingLeaderboard` class uses an additional sorted set to rank the scores, so please keep this in mind when you are doing any capacity planning for Redis with respect to memory usage.

Competition ranking: The `CompetitionRankingLeaderboard` subclass of `Leaderboard` allows you to define a leaderboard where members with the same score will have the same rank, and then a gap is left in the ranking numbers. For example, members in a leaderboard with the associated scores would have the ranks of:

```
| member     | score | rank |
-----------------------------
| member_1   | 50    | 1    |
| member_2   | 50    | 1    |
| member_3   | 30    | 3    |
| member_4   | 30    | 3    |
| member_5   | 10    | 5    |
```
